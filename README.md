Super lightweight classes for developing smart gateways to populate a business knowlege base 
compliant with [KEES](http://linkeddata.center/kees) model.

## quickstart

The package is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/botk/core).
You can install it using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
composer require botk/core
```

## Installation

This package require [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

Add following dependance to **composer.json** file in your project root:

```
    {
        "require": {

        }
    }
```

## Usage

See [examples](examples/) directory.

## BOTK Language profile

The BOTK language profile it is a Semantic Web application profile that extends schema.org with some business related stuff. 
BOTK is compatible with KEES (Knowledge Exchange Engine Schema) applications.

Following vocabularies are partially supported:

The primary focus o BOTK are Local Business, defined as a legal organization Business witha physical postal address contact point. 
BOTK vocabulary extends schema.org with some custom resource related to businesses:

## String context
No string context should be used to qualify strings.

## BOTK annotations

### botk:[near]
States that the annotated subject  is near (from a geographic point of view) to a another object.

### botk:[similarStreet]
This functiona property States that the annotated LocalBusiness has an address translitteration
(i.e. the string representation of a postal address  from a lexical point of view) similar
to the the one of another local business  (e.g "Via Leonardo Da Vinci,1 - NAPOLI" is similar to "Viale L.Davinci,1 - MILANO").

### botk:[similarName]
States that the annotated subject has a schema:alternateName that is 
to the the one of another object (e.g "BAR Roma" is similar to "CaffÃ¨ di Roma").

## Restrictiosn

## schema:LocalBusiness

Captures the concept about a public legal registered business organization  with a contactable geographic selling point .	
This class can be specialized  to state the reason of the business interest (e.g. see schema:LocalBusiness classifications).


Following properties/annotations supported: 

- rdf:type	with cardinality >= 1 ,  type in the form of prefix:classname at least schema:LocalBusiness must be present
- schema:vatID with cardinality <= 1, as Inverse Functional Property in country context ??
- schema:taxID with cardinality <= 1,
- schema:legalName with cardinality <= 1, as the legal name of the location
- schema:alternateName with cardinality >= 0, contains the insignia of the shop as normalized text
- schema:address  with cardinality <=1 , contact info for this local business  as a schema:PostalAddress individual
- schema:geo with cardinality <= 1 pointer a schema:GeoCoordinates
- schema:hasMap with cardinality >= 0 pointer an URL with a map of the place
- schema:telephone with cardinality >= 0, formatted as string with no space, can start with '+', if 00 is present at the beginning,it is substituted with +, as primary telephone contact point for this location
- schema:faxNumber with cardinality >= 0, same formatting of telephone, as primary fax  contact point for this organization
- schema:email with cardinality >= 0,  as  email for a contact point for this organization
- schema:aggregateRating with cardinality <= 1,  as a schema:AggregateRating instance, schema:ratingValue attribute must be present as non negative float value
- schema:openingHours with cardinality <= 1,  if  ="permanantly closed" the local business is permanantly closed

Example (in rdf turtle):
```
ex:org1 a schema:LocalBusiness, schema:HealthAndBeautyBusiness ;
	schema:vatID "01209991007" ;
	schema:legalName "ERBORISTERIA \"I PRATI\" DI GIOVANNA MONAMI S.A.S." ;
	schema:alternateName "ERBORISTERIA I PRATI", "I PRATI", "I PRATI DI GIOVANNA MONAMI" ;
	schema:telephone "063700061" ;
	schema:email "INFO@IPRATI.IT" ;
	schema:address ex:org1_address1;
	schema:geo <geo:41.914,12.464163>;
	schema:aggregateRating [ a schema:AggregateRating; schema:ratingValue 4.1 ];
	schema:hasMap <https://maps.google.com/?cid=11195466023234233409836>;
.
```

## schema:PostalAddress 

Captures a contact point with a postal address
- schema:description with cardinality = 1 as  normalizzed string from template "DUF DUG, CIVIC, ZIP LOCALITY", es "LUNGOLARIO CESARE BATTISTI, 5, 23900 LECCO LC" ) 
- schema:addressCountry with cardinality = 1, Country  in two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code no language specs
- schema:addressLocality with cardinality <= 1, The locality as normalized string. For example, "MILANO". Sholud be present in an official country adminstrative db as SKOS:primaryName or rdfs:label
- schema:addressRegion	with cardinality <= 1, The second administrative level as normalized string. For example, "MI". . Sholud be present in country adminstrative db as SKOS:primaryName
- schema:streetAddress	with cardinality <= 1,	a normalizzed string from template "DUF DUG, CIVIC". For example, "VIA ANTONIO MORDINI, 3"
- schema:postalCode	with cardinality <= 1,	Text 	The postal code. For example, 94043.

Example (in rdf turtle):
```
ex:org1_address1 a schema:PostalAddress ;	
	schema:alternateName 
		"VIA ANTONIO MORDINI, 3, 00195 ROMA RM",
		"VIA ANTONIO MORDINI, 3 - ROMA";
	schema:addressCountry "IT";
	schema:addressLocality "ROMA";
	schema:streetAddress "VIA ANTONIO MORDINI, 3";
	schema:addressRegion "RM";
	schema:postalCode "00195";
.
```

## schema:GeoCoordinates

Captures the center of a geographic location that is related with a place (not with an postal address)

The geo uri SHOULD be formatted according [rfc 5870](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5870)
Following properties/annotations supported: 

- wgs:lat with cardinality = 1,
- wgs:long with cardinality = 1

Both lat and long shold be conformant to following regexp: *^-?([1-8]?[0-9]\.{1}\d{1,20}$|90\.{1}0{1,20}$)*

Example (in rdf turtle):
```
<geo:41.914,12.464163> a schema:GeoCoordinates ;
	wgs:lat 41.914 ;
	wgs:long 12.464163 ;
.
```

## owl:Thing

Following properties/annotations supported for all object: 

- foaf:homepage with cardinality >= 0 strictly as Inverse Functional Property
- foaf:page with cardinality >= 0a web page related to the resource
- dct:identifier with cardinality <= 1 an unique identifier in the context of the subject namespace.
- owl:sameAs with cardinality >= 0,URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity.
- schema:disambiguatingDescription with cardinality >= 0, A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items (e.g a category)

Example (in rdf turtle):
```
	ex:org1_address owl:sameAs ex2:org2_address .
	ex:org1_address schema:disambiguatingDescription "restaurant", "food", "point_of_interest","establishment" .
```

## Data trust ##

Trust in data can be expressed according with the [Dataset Quality Vocabulary (daQ)](http://butterbur04.iai.uni-bonn.de/ontologies/daq/daq).
Quality observation can be associated to object or reficated statements :

Example (in rdf turtle):
```
	# trust level about an individual
	ex:obs1 a qb:Observation ;
		daq:computedOn ex:localbusines_1 ;
		dct:date "2014-01-23T14:53:01"^^xsd:dateTime ;
		daq:value "1.0"^^xsd:double ;
		daq:metric botk:trustMetric ;
		daq:computedBy [ foaf:homepage <http://linkeddata.center> ] ;
		daq:isEstimated false .
		
	# trust level about a statement		
	ex:obs2 a qb:Observation ;
		daq:computedOn [
			a rdf:Statement;
			rdf:subject	ex:org1_address;
			rdf:predicate owl:sameAs;
			rdf:object ex2:org2_address;
		];
		daq:value "0.6"^^xsd:double ;
		daq:metric kees:trustMetric ;
		daq:isEstimated true .
.
```


## Reasoning requrement

Following properties/entities should be (at least partially) supported in BOTK reasoning:

- owl:sameAs
- owl:FunctionalProperty
- owl:InverseFunctionalProperty
- rdfs:subClassOf
